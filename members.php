        <p class="bio">Born in February of 1996, Echo Arlo founded Upper Left at the age of 16 years old as an aspiring artist. 
            Pursuit and interest in music early on exposed him to numerous genres from Hip-Hop to Folk and everything in between. 
            Considered a leading vocalist, Echo Arlo composes, writes, sings, raps, and plays guitar. 
            His debut Hip-Hop album "Confidence" was released in 2017, with a follow up record to be announced this upcoming year.

        <p class="bio">Born in February of 1995, Stone is a guitarist from Olympia WA. After having moved to the UK in the 2000s 
            and Bellingham, WA in 2013, he eventually returned to Olympia in 2021. Being primarily a “bedroom guitarist” most of 
            his playing career, he began taking it more seriously and recording for the first time after reuniting with cousin 
            Echo and childhood friend Hayden. Although mostly inspired by punk rock, Stone's musical taste spans all the way from Tommy 
            James and the Shondells, to Tears for Fears to Lil Wayne. His first release, titled “Gryphons” with Echo coming soon!
